## Description

This app allows the user to add transactions and view them over time in a graph form. They are able to add both monetary gains and losses based on what they are brining in and what they are spending. This allows the user to better budget their expenses. This app stores information/transactions for the user so that if the application is offline, they can still view stored transactions. They can also post new transactions while offline and these transactions will be added to the cached/stored file when the application comes back online.
